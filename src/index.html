      <h2>General introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Alright, so, since I don't quite know where this is going yet I'll just
        <br />
        use this as an opportunity to talk a bit about myself. I am a passionate
        <br />
        developer with a focus on backend programming. In my freetime I
        <br />
        like to write code, play games and watch anime. I'll try to include
        <br />
        further information in the next sections, such as...
        <br />
      </p>
      <a href="./pages/using_lists.html">
        <button>Some lists</button>
      </a>
      <p>I've prepared a few lists to show you in this section.</p>

      <a href="./pages/using_images.html">
        <button>Some images</button>
      </a>
      <p>Honestly, you don't want to click this...</p>

      <a href="./pages/pie_recipe.html">
        <button>Butterscotch pie recipe</button>
      </a>
      <p>This is a random recipe I've found online. Hope you like it!</p>
