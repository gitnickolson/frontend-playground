    <h2>General introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Alright, so, since I don't quite know where this is going yet I'll just
      <br />
      use this as an opportunity to talk a bit about myself. I am a passionate
      <br />
      developer with a focus on backend programming. In my freetime I
      <br />
      like to write code, play games and watch anime. I'll try to include
      <br />
      further information in the next sections, such as...
      <br />
    </p>

    <h3><a href="./pages/using_lists.html">Using lists</a></h3>
    <p>I've prepared a few lists to show you in this section.</p>

    <h3><a href="./pages/using_images.html">Using images</a></h3>
    <p>Honestly, you don't want to click this...</p>

    <h3><a href="./pages/pie_recipe.html">Butterscotch Pie recipe</a></h3>
    <p>This is a random recipe I've found online. Hope you like it!</p>
